## Result
Our project's model achieved remarkably high accuracy, a result that, while promising, warrants careful scrutiny. This unprecedented performance raises questions about potential overfitting, data leakage, or biases within our training dataset. Such issues could artificially inflate the model's apparent effectiveness, especially when dealing with real-world, noisy data.  

## Future direction  
To ensure the robustness and applicability of our findings, several steps to undertake:  

* ***Cross-Validation***: Implement more rigorous cross-validation techniques to assess model generalizability across different data subsets.  
* ***External Dataset Evaluation***: Test the model on additional, external ECG datasets to validate its performance in a broader context.  
* ***Complexity Reduction***: Explore simplifying the model to reduce the risk of overfitting while maintaining high accuracy.  
* ***Bias Mitigation***: Investigate and correct for any potential biases in the dataset that may contribute to overly optimistic results.
